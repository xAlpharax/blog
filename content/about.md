Hi there!

You've found my corner of organised anarchy on the internet. Welcome!

Here you'll see the following general topics:

- AI (both engineering and research)
- Programming (mainly fun things)
- Linux & FOSS (because there are always cool things to share)
- Math (which I'm currently studying)

I'm pretty much sticking to these. Feel free to contact me if you want to.
