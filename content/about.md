Hi there! My name is Iustin. I'm a math student from Romania with a background in AI development and research. This blog represents my attempt at sharing personal thoughts and experiences as a follow-through venture in AI research, mathematics, philosophy and Linux related things, as well as a bunch of other things that define my interests.

I wish to write interesting, useful, qualitative and fun content for you to read and learn from. I hope you will enjoy!

Welcome to my corner of organised anarchy on the internet! Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or comments or would like to chat. I am always happy and open to meet passionate people.
