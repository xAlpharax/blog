Hello, World! This is my first post on my new blog. I'm excited to share my thoughts with you.

First off, how did I make this? I used Zola - a static site generator written in Rust. It's fast, easy to use, and has lots of features.

Design : markdown rendered pages ; css-only animations and eyecandy ; minimal js ; must have atom rss

You can find the source code for this blog on my GitHub as well as on [my own git instance](https://git.alphara.art/blog).
